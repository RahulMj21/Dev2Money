# How to write code 5x faster

[Rahul Mondal](https://rahulmondal.vercel.app)

Software engineering and running a business can both feel overwhelming at times.
When an architect designs a building, he’s working with physical realities. We also have many other buildings to compare it to. And people generally understand the limitations of what buildings can and cannot do.

In software, your manager won’t know how to code, and they may not even know how to use a computer. He’ll make up what he wants on the spot and then change his mind a dozen times. He may not even ask for your input, he’ll create time-estimates out of thin air. It leads to a lot of unrealistic expectations that cause developers to feel anxiety.

This skill will make you more productive and less likely to burn out than your peers. My newfound ability to handle this pressure was a huge advantage I had over my fellow developers.

# Prioritize Tasks

When you’re trying to code, manage your git repo, continuous integration servers, stage+production servers, JIRA, scrums, other developers, managers, testers, etc. It’s a lot of things to manage, and it’s the tip of the iceberg. Plus, each task you add makes the list increasingly complex.

> The key to both business and software engineering is prioritization

# **Get Build Times Down To Zero**

I’ve worked on legacy products that take 5+ minutes to compile. It will absolutely kill productivity. Task switching is an incredibly inefficient use of your time. And when waiting 5-10 minutes for your project to compile, what else can you do?

Most software developers won’t find creative ways to get build times down. They’ll just sit there and deal with the constant task-switching. Being pro-active about this problem will make you faster than your peers.

# Less Code is Usually Better Code

You can find exceptions to every rule, but typically the less code you write the better. When I see verbose code, it comes down to one of the following three issues.

1.You don’t understand data structures, creating objects, methods, or recursion.
1.You don’t understand the full capabilities of your language of choice. (Some library provides 1.this functionality, and you’re not using it)
1.You’ve chosen a bad framework, or a legacy codebase has forced your hand. An example would be many Java developers used to find themselves in XML hell.
1.Very rarely does verbose code need to be that verbose. It’s almost always a type of code smell and should be refactored. The less code you have, the easier it is to maintain.

If you never adapt and learn new tools, you end up as the only Delphi developer left in 2021. Or you become a Java developer who adopts GWT because you’re scared to write JavaScript. Good luck building a modern website with that skillset. You’re irrelevant.

But, if you always use the newest framework, things are equally bad. The modern equivalent is React or Flutter for mobile app development. I’m not saying React and Flutter are a passing fad. I’m just saying Xamarin promised the exact same thing a few years ago. Do you really want to have a Xamarin app right now?

### Let these technologies age a little bit before making your application dependent on it.

Think Outside The Box. Think In General.
A lot of developers are given a task, and they get to work immediately. I commend them for their hustle, but their work-ethic is stupid. They should be asking the following questions.

1. Why am I being asked to do this? Is there a better way?
1. Does this need to be done at all, or is it a big waste of time?
1. What obvious problems are going to arise if I build this the way I’m planning to develop this.
1. Managers don’t often know how to code. In that case, they will often ask you to do very non-sensical things.

> Junior developers will say “how high” when managers ask them to jump. I usually say, “Wait, why do you want me to jump again? Maybe there’s a better way.”

Challenging management is easier said than done. But, avoiding stupid tasks is a tremendous time-saver and worth doing. This will make you much more productive than your peers who don’t do this.

# Learn To Say No

#### _Management will inevitably ask you to do something stupid someday._

You need to learn to say no. It’s hard to do in the moment, but long-term, you’ll never regret not doing stupid things.

Don’t Re-Invent The Wheel
